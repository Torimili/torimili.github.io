    <hr/>
    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species endemic to China.[4] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.</P>
      <p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.</p>

      <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
      <p>Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (4–6 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder.[36][37] Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb).[38] Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males)[39] can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb).[9][36][40] The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).[41]</P>
        <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, limbs and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white.[42] The bear's distinctive coat appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments. The white areas may serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs provide crypsis in shade.[43] Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration while close up, they rely more on blending in.[44] The black ears may signal aggressive intent,[43] while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another.[43][45][46] The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.[42] The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa.[47][48] A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.[citation needed] Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.[49]</p>
      <h3 id="ecology">Ecology</h3>
      <p>Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.[51] However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[55] and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[56][57] Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[58] The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.[59]</p>
      <p>Two of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: "[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo."[63] Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw.[63] Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.</p>
      <p>The morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2–2.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta.[64][65] Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor, resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons.[66] Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda.[67] Although the pseudogenisation of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change.[65][66][67] The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya[65] while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya,[64] signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.</p>
    <h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>
    <p>The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan.[75] Giant pandas are generally solitary.[59] Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.[76] After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.</p>
    <p>Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, they can be active at any time of the day.[78] Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following March.[79] Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days.</p>
    <p>Pandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine.[9] They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures.[80] Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.</p>
  <h3 id="human">Human Use and Interaction</h3>
    <p>In the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures – the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia Erya.</p>
    <p>The creature named mo (貘) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda.[103] The dictionary Shuowen Jiezi (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the mo, from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black,[104] although the older Erya describes mo simply as a "white leopard".[105] The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature pixiu (貔貅) as referring to the giant panda is also common.</p>
    <p>During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured zouyu (騶虞), and another zouyu was sighted in Shandong. Zouyu is a legendary "righteous" animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the creature captured during the Yongle era, Dutch Sinologist J. J. L. Duyvendak exclaimed, "Can it possibly have been a Pandah?</p>
